We currently have multiple cute dragon types that kids can interact with in real time. They receive live updates on their devices and can watch their dragons play, eat, push objects, level up, and grow. The experience is designed to feel lively, warm, and full of charm.
In this video, we showcase our dragons’ core movement system, featuring smooth flying and a set of basic abilities. We introduce the four elemental dragon types—Ice, Earth, Fire, and Lightning—and demonstrate their unique special powers, including instant teleportation and invisibility.
Kids can also host fun dance parties with synchronized animations and dynamic DMX-style light effects. The animation controller and VFX systems (DMX Plugin) are built independently, allowing artists and developers to work in parallel without blocking each other.
A talking dragon module is also being integrated, enabling dragons to respond and interact with kids in a more personal and engaging way. The combat system is currently under active development. The project is being built with console support in mind, including PS5 and Nintendo Switch.
